# Hi, I'm Laurence

I am an economist and researcher based in New York City, working as a consultant and serving as adjunct faculty at Columbia University and NYU. My work spans applied research, policy analysis, and teaching, with a focus on understanding how economic institutions shape economic outcomes.

I use this space to host my academic research, book projects, teaching materials, and experimental apps and tools.

## Current Projects

- **Digital History:** Building a panel dataset of historical South African electoral and magisterial districts for an economic history of Apartheid (1969-1989).
- **Policy Tools:** Developing a [Fiscal Policy Calculator](https://github.com/laurencehw/fiscal-policy-calculator) to analyze economic impacts of tax and spending changes.
- **Budget Analysis:** Analyzing South African budgetary reports in my [brrr_recs](https://github.com/laurencehw/brrr_recs) repository to identify policy options.
- **Writing:** Drafting textbooks on [Economic Coercion](https://github.com/laurencehw/economic-coercion), [The American Economy](https://github.com/laurencehw/the-american-economy), and [others](https://laurence-wilse-samson.gitbook.io/textbooks/).
